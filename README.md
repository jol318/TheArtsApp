My History App

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Arts App

**1) Purpose**

The purpose of The Arts App is to give information to the user about
different historical figures and at what age they died. The target
audience is children. This app can be used for information purposes or
for fun if they get curious. This app will also be helpful for both
teachers and parents.

**2) Design Considerations**

Intuitive Design:

My app is quite easy to follow. Everything follows the structure from
top to bottom. The main imageview is seen at the top of the page and the
edittext is placed under it. Under the edit text, the two buttons are
next to each other from left to right. At the bottom, the text view and
image view follow the same structure from left to right.

Content Prioritization:

The app prioritizes the most necessary elements that will make this app
run successfully. Two buttons are included in the app for generating and
clearing information. The main text at the top of the page displays what
the app is about, and the text view displays information. Lastly the
edittext inputs the ages of the figures.

Legible text content:

It is quite easy to read the text in the app. The text sizes in all the
formats are big enough to be read. The textview that give the
information is the size of 20dp. The app is not only targeted towards
children but all age groups, so it is important for everyone to read it.

Make Interface Elements Clearly Visible:

The interface is not too crowded. There is enough white space, and all
the components are spaced well apart to be clearly seen. The colour also
plays a big part in the interface. It was important to use more natural
colours as this is easy on the user's eyes. The colours I mainly used
was pink and brown. It was an important decision to have the app evoke a
sense of calmness and peace. The users shouldn't be too overwhelmed with
colour and elements in the app.

Hand position controls:

All the buttons are placed in such a way that it is easy to reach. All
the buttons and edit texts are placed in the middle of the screen.

Images:

I decided to use the images I did to illustrate the beauty of art. This
app is all about the arts, including painting, instruments, music, and
anything that inspires the mind. The main image on top is a painting
about interesting architecture in China. This is the first image that is
seen when the app is opened; it needs to draw some attention. I also
wanted to include some type of Asian culture references for the images,
as my app includes many figures from the east. The second picture is
placed at the bottom left to give the page more detail and it plays a
role in generating other images. The second image includes a drawing of
a Chinese instrument. When the age has been input, the information on
the historical figure pops up. The imageview gives an image
corresponding to the information.
